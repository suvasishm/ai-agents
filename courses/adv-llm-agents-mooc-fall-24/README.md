## Lecture 1: LLM Reasoning

<details>

### **Executive Summary**

This document explores the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), moving beyond their basic functionality as text predictors. The core argument is that the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps, mimicking human thought processes, is crucial for achieving effective problem-solving in LLMs. The document outlines various techniques to elicit this reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and Self-Consistency, while also acknowledging limitations like sensitivity to irrelevant information and issues with self-correction.

---

### **Key Themes and Ideas**

#### **The Need for Reasoning in AI**
- The author questions whether current machine learning (ML), which often requires vast amounts of data, truly reflects artificial intelligence. They propose that a key missing element is reasoning, stating: *"Humans can learn from just a few examples because humans can reason."*
- A simple “last letter concatenation” task is used to highlight the deficiency of standard ML approaches and how LLMs can overcome this.
- The document points out a core concept: *"AI should be able to learn from just a few examples, like what humans usually do."*

#### **LLMs as Language Mimics and the Power of Intermediate Steps**
- LLMs are described as *"transformer"* models trained to predict the next word based on vast amounts of text, comparing their training to *"training parrots to mimic human languages."* This highlights their capacity for language manipulation.
- The paper emphasizes that LLMs can generate reasoning if prompted or trained correctly. The key concept is to *"derive the final answer through intermediate steps."*
- This point is illustrated with the *"last-letter-concatenation"* task by prompting the model to show its working, and with more complex math-based questions.

#### **Techniques for Eliciting Reasoning**
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:**
  - *"Regardless of training, fine-tuning, or prompting, when provided with examples that include intermediate steps, LLMs will respond with intermediate steps."*
  - Demonstrates that prompting with step-by-step reasoning significantly improves accuracy.

- **Least-to-Most Prompting:**
  - Breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, allowing for easier generalization.
  - Example: *"Let's break down this problem: 1. How many apples does Anna have? 2. How many apples do Elsa and Anna have together?”*

- **Analogical Reasoning:**
  - LLMs can be prompted to recall related problems before attempting the current task.
  - *"A mathematician is a person who can find analogies between theorems; a better mathematician is one who can see analogies between proofs and the best mathematician can notice analogies between theories."* — Stefan Banach

- **Chain-of-Thought Decoding (Without Explicit Prompting):**
  - A less greedy decoding strategy allows LLMs to reveal step-by-step reasoning even without direct prompts.

- **Self-Consistency:**
  - Improves step-by-step reasoning by sampling multiple responses and selecting the most frequent answer.
  - *"More consistent, more likely to be correct."*

- **Universal Self-Consistency (USC):**
  - LLMs self-select the most consistent response, but *"the most consistent response"* is not always the most frequent.

#### **Theoretical Basis**
- *"There is nothing more practical than a good theory.”* — Kurt Lewin
- Argues that constant-depth transformers can solve inherently serial problems by generating sufficiently long intermediate steps.

---

### **Limitations of LLM Reasoning**

#### **Distraction by Irrelevant Context**
- LLMs can be easily distracted by irrelevant information in prompts, similar to humans.
- A significant performance drop is observed when irrelevant information is added to problems from the GSM8k dataset.

#### **Lack of Self-Correction**
- While LLMs can be prompted to review their responses, self-correction sometimes worsens the answer.
- Indicates that self-correction is not robust without access to an "oracle" answer.

#### **Importance of Premise Order**
- The order of information presented in a problem affects LLM reasoning capabilities.
- Random ordering results in a performance drop, showing that *"Premise Order Matters in Reasoning."*

---

### **Future Directions and Open Questions**
- The author calls for a model that can autonomously learn reasoning techniques and overcome identified limitations.
- Emphasizes the need to better understand these challenges before attempting to fix them.
- *"If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it."* — Albert Einstein

---

### **Key Quotes**
- *"Humans can learn from just a few examples because humans can reason."*
- *"Make things as simple as possible but no simpler."* — Albert Einstein
- *"Derive the final answer through a series of small steps."*
- *"Regardless of training, fine-tuning, or prompting, when provided with examples that include intermediate steps, LLMs will respond with intermediate steps."*
- *"The truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought.”* — Richard P. Feynman
- *"The best way to predict the future is to invent it."* — Alan Kay

---

### **Conclusion**

This document highlights the critical role of reasoning in the development of advanced AI. It demonstrates that LLMs can be coaxed into reasoning using various techniques but acknowledges current limitations in areas such as self-correction and handling irrelevant information. Future LLM research must address these limitations to unlock their full potential for solving complex problems.

### Google Notebook Brief:

<details>

## **1. Introduction**  
This document provides a structured overview of the evolution and current state of **Large Language Model (LLM) agents**, drawing insights from *L2_llm_agent_history.pdf* by **Shunyu Yao**. It covers key concepts, historical evolution, reasoning mechanisms, and future research challenges. The presentation underscores the importance of **abstraction, generality, and learning from past methodologies**, while also addressing practical applications and existing limitations.  

## **2. Defining "Agent" and "LLM Agent"**  
An **agent** is an "intelligent" system that interacts with an **environment**, which can be:  
- **Physical**: Robots, autonomous cars  
- **Digital**: Atari game AI, Siri, AlphaGo  
- **Human-Interfacing**: Chatbots  

The definition of an agent is dynamic, evolving based on interpretations of **"intelligence"** and **"environment."**  

### **Classification of LLM Agents**  
LLM agents are categorized into three levels:  
1. **Text Agent**  
   - Uses **text as both action and observation**  
   - Examples: **ELIZA** (rule-based chatbot), **LSTM-DQN** (deep RL for text-based games)  
   - **Limitations**: Domain-specific, lacks generalization  

2. **LLM Agent**  
   - Uses LLMs to **process inputs and generate actions**  
   - Examples: **SayCan**, **Language Planner**  

3. **Reasoning Agent**  
   - Uses **LLMs to reason before acting**  
   - Examples: **ReAct**, **AutoGPT**  
   - The **main focus** of the discussion  

## **3. Historical Context**  
The document traces the progression of **AI agents** through three distinct eras:  

1. **Symbolic AI Agents**  
   - Example: **ELIZA (1966)** – A **rule-based text agent**  
   - **Challenges**: "Domain-specific," "manual design required," **limited adaptability**  

2. **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agents**  
   - Example: **LSTM-DQN (2015)** – Used deep RL for language-based tasks  
   - **Challenges**: Requires **scalar reward signals**, extensive training  

3. **LLM Agents**  
   - Emerged due to the **few-shot learning** capability of LLMs  
   - **Trained via next-token prediction on large text corpora**  
   - **Inference through few-shot prompting for diverse tasks**

To address these issues, the **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting) approach was introduced, emphasizing:  
- **"Synergy of reasoning and acting"**  
- **Systematic exploration**  
- **Integration of external feedback**  

The structured reasoning-action loop allows the agent to:  
1. **Analyze observations**  
2. **Formulate reasoning-based thoughts**  
3. **Execute informed actions**  
4. **Adjust reasoning based on outcomes**  

> *"Acting supports reasoning, reasoning guides acting."*  

## **5. Long-Term Memory and Learning**  
### **Challenges of Short-Term Memory**  
- **"Append-only" nature**
